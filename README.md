# Website

## Todo

* Create a `individual page for a spotter ID` (include a map to plot the departure airport, arrival airport, route planned and the geo coordinates of the aircraft as it was recorded).
* Add a `Group By` option in the `advanced search` page. Style the output accordingly.
* Add `Print styles` for the `advanced search` page for a better printing experience.
* Add a `export option` for the `advanced search` page. Perhaps integrate that with the `API`?
* Look into `query LEFT JOIN slowness`.
* `Include images` for each `aircraft type page`.
* `Improve the front page`. Perhaps add line graph or even a map of todays entries.
